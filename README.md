Local Outlier Factor and Isolation Forest Algorithm are implemented for outlier detection.

Local Outlier Factor (LOF) measures the local deviation of density of a given sample with respect to its neighbors and itdepends on how isolated the object is with respect to the neighbourhood surrounding.

Isolation Forest Algorithm The IsolationForest ‘isolates’ observations by randomly selecting a feature and then randomly selecting a split value between the maximum and minimum values of the selected feature. Since recursive partitioning can be represented by a tree structure, the number of splittings required to isolate a sample is equivalent to the path length from the root node to the terminating node. This path length, averaged over a forest of such random trees, is a measure of normality and our decision function. Random partitioning produces noticeably shorter paths for anomalies. Hence, when a forest of random trees collectively produce shorter path lengths for particular samples, they are highly likely to be anomalies.
